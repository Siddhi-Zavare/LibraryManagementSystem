Library Management System

The Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based java application which follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This structure allows modular development, easier maintenance, and scalability. The console-based MVC LMS provides basic functionality for managing library resources and user interactions.

Controller (C):
